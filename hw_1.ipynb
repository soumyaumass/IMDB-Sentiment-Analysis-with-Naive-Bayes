    "- What version of Python should I use? 3.6!\n",
    "\n",
    "- Most of these questions require writing Python code and computing results, and the rest of them have textual answers. To generate the answers, you will have to fill out a supporting file, `hw1.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For all of the textual answers you have to fill out have placeholder text which says \"Answer in one or two sentences here.\" For each question, you need to replace \"Answer in one or two sentences here\" with your answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write all the answers in this ipython notebook. Once you are finished (1) Generate a PDF via (File -> Download As -> PDF) and upload to Gradescope (2)Turn in `hw_1.py` and `hw_1.ipynb` on Moodle.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Important** check your PDF before you turn it in to gradescope to make sure it exported correctly. If ipython notebook gets confused about your syntax it will sometimes terminate the PDF creation routine early. If your whole PDF does not print, try running `$jupyter nbconvert --to pdf 2018hw1.ipynb` to identify and fix any syntax errors that might be causing problems\n",
    "\n",
    "- When creating your final version of the PDF to hand in, please do a fresh restart and execute every cell in order. Then you'll be sure it's actually right. One handy way to do this is by clicking `Cell -> Run All` in the notebook menu.\n",
    " \n",
    "- This assignment is designed so that you can run all cells in a few minutes of computation time. If it is taking longer than that, you probably have made a mistake in your code."

    "Zipf's Law describes the relations between the frequency rank of words and frequency value of words.  For a word $w$, its frequency is inversely proportional to its rank:\n",

Use a scatter plot where the x-axis is the *log(rank)*, and y-axis is *log(frequency)*.  You should get this information from `word_counts`; for example, you can take the individual word counts and sort them.  dict methods `.items()` and/or `values()` may be useful.  (Note that it doesn't really matter whether ranks start at 1 or 0 in terms of how the plot comes out.) You can check your results by comparing your plots to ones on Wikipedia; they should look qualitatively similar.\n",

I will give that this movie could have been better. A million little things could have been changed to make it better.<br /><br />That having been said I love this movie. I'm often sad that people misunderstand the whole point of it. It has always been clear to me that the point of this movie was to say... things aren't always what they seem. Sometimes 'evil', isn't. <br /><br />Barker was at a Con I went to and he did a little talk then watch the movie thing. It was very interesting. Many things he wished to put in the movie couldn't be, and a chunk was cut out of the movie that he believed to be long lost. This was a chunk that helped shed light on Boone and his Girlfriend, as well as some other details.<br /><br />I know some people are bothered by not having more information about all of the 'breed' in the background, however I always felt that gave the movie a more 'real' fleshed out feel. I have read the novella this was based off of as well as many of the comics. Because of this, the movie just always seemed like a staging ground for the whole story. A much more involved story that sadly has never has a chance to live. <br /><br />Despite all of the flaws this movie might have I believe it has a lot to offer. The 'monsters' are wonderful, very imaginative. While the acting is sometimes a bit stiff there are some very quotable lines. Whenever I watch it I find something new. Keep and eye on Boones chest toward the end. At one point Decker stabs him and shortly after Boone falls on a card table. He ends up with a card stuck to his chest. This card stays there for a while even after Lori pulls the knife out. It stays there until Boone casually removes it. I love that. That was a lovely little detail I thought.<br /><br />Basically what I want to say is that... if you are looking for a horror movie, don't watch this. If you believe that at times men can be more evil than anything we have ever dreamed up. This is the movie for you. This is a movie about how men destroy what they don't understand or fear.\n"
